# Dedicated Category Pages Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of dedicated category pages for the TechNexus Blog.

## Overview

Dedicated category pages provide users with a focused view of articles belonging to a specific topic (e.g., `/categories/web-development`). This implementation includes:

1.  **Dynamic Routing**: Using Next.js App Router for routes like `/categories/[slug]`.
2.  **Data Fetching**: Fetching both category details (name, description) and a paginated list of articles for the specific category.
3.  **Infinite Scroll**: Implementing infinite scroll for the article list, reusing the pattern from the homepage's Latest Articles section.
4.  **Robust State Handling**: Managing loading, error (for category details and articles), and empty states gracefully.
5.  **Component Reuse**: Utilizing existing components like `ArticleCard` and `Skeleton`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dynamic Route

Created the file structure `src/app/categories/[slug]/page.tsx` to handle dynamic category routes.

### 2. GraphQL Queries

Added/updated the following queries in `src/lib/graphql/queries.ts`:
- `GET_CATEGORY_DETAILS`: Fetches name, slug, and description for a category.
- `GET_CATEGORY_PAGE_ARTICLES`: Fetches a paginated list of articles for a given category slug.

### 3. Mock Data System

Updated `src/lib/api/mockData.ts` to:
- Include mock details (name, description) for various categories.
- Add more mock articles to categories (e.g., web-development) to test pagination.
- Enhance the `mockGraphQLHandler` to respond to `GetCategoryDetails` and `GetCategoryPageArticles` queries, including pagination logic.

### 4. React Query Hooks

Created two new custom hooks:
- `useCategoryDetails`: Fetches and caches category details based on the slug.
- `useCategoryPageArticles`: Fetches and manages paginated article data for a specific category slug using `useInfiniteQuery`.

### 5. Category Page Component

Implemented the main page component (`src/app/categories/[slug]/page.tsx`) which:
- Extracts the category `slug` from the URL parameters.
- Uses `useCategoryDetails` to fetch and display the category name and description.
- Uses `useCategoryPageArticles` to fetch and display the list of articles in a grid.
- Implements infinite scroll using `react-intersection-observer` to automatically load more articles.
- Handles various loading states (initial load, loading more articles).
- Displays specific error messages if category details or articles fail to load.
- Shows an appropriate message if the category is not found or has no articles.

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1.  Navigating to a category page URL (e.g., `/categories/web-development`, `/categories/ai-ml`).
2.  Verifying that the correct category name and description are displayed.
3.  Checking that the relevant articles for the category are shown.
4.  Scrolling down to test the infinite scroll functionality.
5.  Testing loading states by observing skeleton loaders.
6.  Testing error states (e.g., by navigating to a non-existent category slug like `/categories/invalid-slug` or modifying the mock handler to simulate errors).
7.  Verifying responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## Next Steps

Potential next steps include:
1.  Linking the "View All" buttons in the homepage's Category Showcase section to these new pages.
2.  Adding category-specific filtering or sorting options to the category pages.
3.  Implementing breadcrumbs for better navigation.
4.  Further styling refinements based on final design mockups.
