# TechNexus Blog: Dynamic Featured Articles Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamic Featured Articles section implementation for the TechNexus Blog. The Featured Articles section now fetches data from a GraphQL API (with mock support for development) and includes proper loading, error, and success states, following the same robust pattern established with the HeroSection.

## Implementation Details

### 1. GraphQL Query Definition

- Utilized the existing `ARTICLE_FRAGMENT` for consistent data structure
- Defined a specific query for featured articles in `/src/lib/graphql/queries.ts`:

  ```graphql
  export const GET_FEATURED_ARTICLES = gql`
    query GetFeaturedArticles($limit: Int = 3) {
      featuredArticles(limit: $limit) {
        ...ArticleFields
      }
    }
    ${ARTICLE_FRAGMENT}
  `;
  ```

- The query supports a `limit` parameter to control the number of articles returned

### 2. React Query Hook Implementation

- Created a custom hook in `/src/hooks/useFeaturedArticles.ts`
- The hook leverages React Query for data fetching, caching, and state management
- Configurable options include:
  - `limit`: Number of articles to fetch
  - `enabled`: Whether the query should auto-execute
  - `initialData`: Optional initial data for SSR or static content

### 3. FeaturedArticlesSection Component Refactoring

The FeaturedArticlesSection component now includes:

- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Data fetching with the useFeaturedArticles hook
- Three distinct UI states:
  1. **Loading State**: Skeleton UI with animation for each article card
  2. **Error State**: User-friendly error message with refresh option
  3. **Success State**: Grid of article cards with proper styling
- "View All" link for navigation to a dedicated featured articles page

### 4. Mock Data System Integration

- Added mock featured articles data in `/src/lib/api/mockData.ts`
- Updated the mock GraphQL handler to support the featuredArticles query
- Implemented limit parameter support to match real API behavior

### 5. Homepage Integration

- Updated the HomePage component to use the dynamic FeaturedArticlesSection
- Removed static article data passing, allowing the component to fetch its own data
- Ensured seamless integration with other homepage sections

## Technical Implementation

### Loading State

The loading state displays skeleton UI elements that match the structure of the article cards:

- Animated pulse effect for visual feedback
- Placeholder elements for images, category tags, titles, excerpts, and author info
- Maintains the same grid layout as the success state for a smooth transition

### Error State

The error state provides a user-friendly experience when data fetching fails:

- Clear error message explaining the issue
- Refresh button to retry the data fetch
- Contained within the section's layout to maintain page structure

### Success State

The success state renders the fetched featured articles:

- Grid layout with responsive behavior
- Each article displayed in an ArticleCard component
- "View All" link for navigation to more content

## Development Workflow

### Using Mock Data

The implementation uses the same mock data system as the HeroSection:

- Toggle between mock and real API in `/src/lib/api/fetchGraphQL.ts`
- Mock data closely resembles what would be returned by a real API
- Simulated network delay for realistic testing

### Testing Different States

To test different states of the FeaturedArticlesSection:

1. **Loading State**: Increase the delay in the mock handler
2. **Error State**: Modify the mock handler to throw an error for the featuredArticles query
3. **Empty State**: Return an empty array from the mock handler

## Next Steps

1. Apply the same pattern to other homepage sections (CategoryShowcase, TopPicks, LatestArticles)
2. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for initial data to improve performance and SEO
3. Add pagination support for sections that might have many items
4. Implement filtering and sorting options

## Conclusion

The Featured Articles section now follows the same robust pattern as the HeroSection, with dynamic data fetching, proper state handling, and seamless integration with the mock data system. This implementation provides a solid foundation for making the remaining homepage sections dynamic as well.
