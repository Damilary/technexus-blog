# Dynamic Category Showcase Section Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of dynamic data fetching for the Category Showcase section of the TechNexus Blog homepage.

## Overview

The Category Showcase section displays a curated list of articles from a specific category. This implementation enhances the section by:

1. Fetching articles dynamically based on category slug
2. Implementing loading, error, and empty states
3. Maintaining consistency with the established data fetching pattern
4. Supporting the mock data system for development and testing

## Implementation Details

### 1. React Query Hook

Created a custom `useCategoryArticles` hook that:
- Accepts category slug and limit parameters
- Uses React Query for data fetching, caching, and state management
- Fetches data from the GraphQL API using the existing query structure
- Provides loading, error, and data states

### 2. Mock Data System

Enhanced the mock data system to:
- Include category-specific article collections
- Support the `articlesByCategory` GraphQL query
- Return appropriate mock data based on category slug
- Simulate network delays for realistic testing

### 3. UI Component

Updated the CategoryShowcaseSection component to:
- Use the custom hook for data fetching
- Display a skeleton loader during loading state
- Show user-friendly error messages when data fetching fails
- Handle empty states gracefully
- Maintain the existing UI design and responsiveness

### 4. Integration

The CategoryShowcaseSection now:
- Fetches its own data rather than receiving it via props
- Handles all possible data states (loading, error, success, empty)
- Maintains the same visual appearance when data is successfully loaded
- Provides a better user experience during loading and error states

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Viewing the homepage to see the dynamic Category Showcase section
2. Checking that articles are correctly filtered by category
3. Testing error handling by temporarily modifying the mock handler
4. Verifying that the UI is responsive across different screen sizes

## Next Steps

Potential next steps include:
1. Implementing dynamic data fetching for the Latest Articles section
2. Adding pagination support for category articles
3. Implementing category filtering or sorting options
4. Creating a dedicated category page that uses the same data fetching pattern
