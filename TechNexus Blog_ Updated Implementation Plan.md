# TechNexus Blog: Updated Implementation Plan

**Date:** May 18, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an updated implementation plan for the TechNexus Blog platform, based on the comprehensive review of:

1. The original gap analysis document
2. The newly provided codebase and documentation
3. The clarified technology stack and architectural decisions
4. The user's detailed instructions in `pasted_content.txt`

The plan outlines a strategic approach to implementing the features and functionality described in the Product Requirements Document (PRD), with a focus on addressing the identified gaps while adhering to the specified technology stack and architectural decisions.

## 2. Key Updates to Implementation Approach

### 2.1. Technology Stack Clarification

The implementation will now explicitly use:

- **Frontend:** Next.js (v14+) with TypeScript (v5+) and Tailwind CSS (v3+), replacing the previous React/Vite approach
- **Backend:** Node.js (v18+ LTS) with Express.js, Apollo Server for GraphQL, and MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** Passport.js with JWT and OAuth providers
- **State Management:** React Query (v5+) and Zustand
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions/GitLab CI

### 2.2. Architectural Approach

The implementation will follow the API-first, microservices architecture outlined in `TechNexus_Blog_system_design.md` and `TechNexus_Blog_tech_stack.md`, with:

- Clear separation between frontend and backend services
- GraphQL and REST API endpoints for data access
- Microservices for authentication, content, user management, search, analytics, recommendations, and notifications
